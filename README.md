# Pollinations.AI Code Generator Webpage

This project is a web application that leverages [Pollinations.AI](https://pollinations.ai) to generate code from a user's prompt. It provides an interactive split-screen interface where:

- The **left side** shows the generated code based on the user's input.
- The **right side** displays a live preview of the running code output.

Additionally, users can export the generated code and output as a Word `.docx` document for further editing and use.

## How It Works

1. User enters a descriptive prompt about the code they want.
2. The app sends the prompt to Pollinations.AI and receives generated code.
3. The code appears on the left panel, where it can be edited if needed.
4. The right panel renders the code live so users can see the output immediately.
5. Users can click a button to export the current code and output into a Word document (`.docx`).
